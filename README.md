# Cloud-Security-Project

### This is a website made by Aamir Ahmed and Griffin Speidel to store documentation on the final project of COSC 55: Security and Privacy.

The project topic we are choosing is “Securing data in transit with a Public Key Infrastructure” as we believe that encryption is an important and interesting part of cybersecurity that we do not know enough about.
