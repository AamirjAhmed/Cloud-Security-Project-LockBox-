# Cloud-Security-Project

### This is a website made by Aamir Ahmed and Griffin Speidel to store documentation on the final project of COSC 55: Security and Privacy.

The project topic we are choosing is “Securing data in transit with a Public Key Infrastructure” as we believe that encryption is an important and interesting part of cybersecurity that we do not know enough about.

In this repo there are milestones completed, including larger company diagrams, application diagrams, and other documentation to mark progress.

The finalized product for this repo should be a bash script that will enable encryption and decryption of files for better security practices (made for a fictional intellegance compay for a country).
