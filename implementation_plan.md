# Cloud Infrastructure Implementation Plan
This plan describes the infrastructure and methodologies involved in the storage and secure transfer of clients' data under our hypothetical model.
## Server
Client data will be held in a secure encrypted server. Data is twice encrypted; once by the client based on their private encryption key, then by a server encryption method that generates a new key each day. Whenever data is in transit, it is further connected by a simple symmetric encryption based on a key generated at the start of communication, like HTTPS.
### Data Encryption
The server receives data that has already been encrypted by the client in their own application, ensuring that only encrypted data is ever transmitted over the internet, and that the company could not access private client information. Once received, the data is encrypted again before entered into storage. Each day, a new key for encryption is generated based on an API pull to randomly iterating data such as population numbers and the number of worldwide google searches performed at the time of generation. Encryption keys would be stored in a completely quarantined location only accessible by physical link into the server algorithms. Upon the generation of a new key, the data is first encrypted with the new key, then decrypted by the old key, and the old key is deleted.
### Firewall
Connections to the server to upload and retrieve data are managed by a firewall that only allows interactions from certified IP addresses. The client sends, along with their data, a certification code that is encrypted using a special client key that the server stores record of for decryption. The client key is only used for certificate encryption; data is encrypted by a key which exists only in the client's records. If the message is coming from a whitelisted IP and sends a valid certificate signed with a registered client key, the operation can be performed.
## Client Applications
Clients will download and run an application that streamlines key management, encryption, and package sending. This enables signing of packets for validation by the server. Customers may pay for a complete package that handles upload, download, and sending operations, or may pay for a simpler version to install on certain machines that only handles some of those operations.
In this plan, we describe a primary client who downloads and uploads files. They wish to share some file with a data recipient application, allowing access to only that file to only that recipient.
### Primary Client Application
Connects to the main server to send an encrypted file. Stores a client key as application data and is loaded with an additional personal encryption key at runtime (never stored). Clients are responsible for managing their own personal encryption keys, but the application offers the functionality to generate one. The application generates the packet with the certificate, encrypted by the client key, and the file, encrypted with the personal encryption key. The packet is sent to the server.
File downloads are performed by sending a request signed by the application certificate, signed by the client key.
In order to privately allow a collaborator access to a file, the primary client generates a shared exchange key. This is sent to the collaborator via secure, validated, encrypted communication. The desired file is uploaded to the server encrypted by the exchange key and marked for access by the collaborator.
### Data Recipient Application
The data recipient can request the file using their own certificate, then decrypt it using the previously shared exchange key.
